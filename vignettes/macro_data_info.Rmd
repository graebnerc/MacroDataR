## Open issues

* Add more tests for duplicated rows, just as with AMECO


## Descriptive statistics
Here is more information about the data.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(MacroDataR)
macro_data_descriptives <- macro_data %>%
  tidyr::gather(variable, value, -iso3c, -year) %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  summarise(mean=mean(value, na.rm=T),
            sd=sd(value, na.rm=T),
            obs=sum(!is.na(value))) %>%
  ungroup()
kable(macro_data_descriptives, caption = "The descriptive statistics")
```

# Information about the package

The package can be used to automatically update the whole dataset.
This way, it is straightforward to use newly published data.

To this end, you can use the function `update_macro_data`, which automatically recompiles the whole dataset.
See `help("update_macro_data", package = "MacroDataR")` for more details.
